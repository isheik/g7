                    <h2>Window Switching</h2>
                    <p>Once you start running a bunch of apps at a time, being able to switch between them accurately becomes very important. Fortunately, Windows 10 provides a large number of ways to do this, and we're going to talk about them here.</p>

                    <h3>Flipping Between Apps</h3>
                    <p>First up, the mighty <kbd>alt + tab</kbd>. This shortcut has been a staple of Windows since the turn of the century, and provides a couple of handy tricks.</p>

                    <p>Quickly tapping <kbd>alt + tab</kbd> will let you flip between two applications. Holding <kbd>alt</kbd> and pressing <kbd>tab</kbd> repeatedly will allow you to step through each app that you have open. Releasing <kbd>alt</kbd> will let you stop on that app. The beauty of this is that now if you use the tap method, you will flip back and forth between this and the most recent other app you had selected.</p>

                    <p>An alternative to this is <kbd>alt + esc</kbd>. This performs the same functionality, but without the pop-up display.</p>

                    <h3>Tiling</h3>
                    <p><kbd>Win + tab</kbd> is a third method for switching apps. However, instead of stepping through them, it neatly tiles them and lets you pick one with your mouse. A neat extra feature is that this will also show any other desktops you have open. If that's new to you, don't worry about that right now. We'll get to that in a few lessons.</p>

                    <h3>Cycling Tabs</h3>
                    <p>Just like switching through apps, you can also cycle through any tabs you have open in your current app. This makes sense in browsers, as well as any other app that features multiple tabs. To cycle forward, use <kbd>ctrl + tab</kbd>, and to cycle backwards use <kbd>ctrl + shift + tab</kbd>.</p>

                    <h3>Closing</h3>
                    <p>Although probably not as useful as the rest of these, <kbd>alt + f4</kbd> is a Windows staple. Pressing this keyboard shortcut will close your current app. This works just like pressing the close button on the app's taskbar, so you'll be asked to save any open files, just like normal.</p>
